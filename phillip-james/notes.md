I started out at https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_dropdown.asp to figure out where we were getting stuck on the hover state and got some ideas for where to move forward.  I added a class to the ul to make it easier to target from the hover state.  The picture doesn't get linked to anything, as long as it's inside .main-nav, it's just taking up space.  The hover state is on its containing element (.main-nav) and changes the rules about how the list is displayed.  
I built out the structure of it, but left it at display:inline.  We'll have to go back with the comp images and build out the structure of the dropdown menu with borders and colors to match the comp images later.
